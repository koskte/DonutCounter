This is a fancy counter for keeping track of how many donuts my friend had promised to eat and how many he had actually eaten at Lantrek2020.
Also a first try at MongoDb.

I imported this as a whole to hide my MongoDb credentials.

# The counter can be seen here https://munkkilaskuri.herokuapp.com/
